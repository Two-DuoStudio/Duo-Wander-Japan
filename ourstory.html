            <p class="disp">
<p>We began this project with one goal—to learn and grow as developers while building something meaningful. Creating a website about Japan gave us the perfect opportunity to practice our skills and challenge ourselves.</p>
<p>At the start, we worked only with <strong>HTML and CSS</strong>, focusing on structure, design, and layout. Every section we created—whether it was about castles, temples, or samurai heritage—was also a test of our coding skills. Through this, we learned the importance of clean design, proper formatting, and user-friendly navigation.</p>
<p>Working together as a team taught us just as much as coding itself. We shared tasks, solved problems, and supported each other whenever things got stuck. Debugging, experimenting, and improving became part of our daily routine.</p>
<p>Right now, our site is built with HTML and CSS, but this is just the foundation. Our next step is adding <strong>JavaScript</strong> to bring more interactivity and life to the project.</p>
<p>This website isn’t just about Japan—it’s also about our journey as developers. And our story is only beginning.</p>
